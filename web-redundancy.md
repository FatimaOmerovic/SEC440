* reputation as fast, efficient, and stable
* typically installed on minimal Linux server install such as RHEL, CENTOS, Ubuntu



Keepalived

* Keepalived implements a set of health checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage load balanced server pools according to their health
* High availability is achieved by Virtual Redundancy Routing Protocol (VRRP), we used it for routers, now we are using it for our devices
